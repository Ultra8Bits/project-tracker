# A simple Project Tracker

## Inspirations
We created the app as part of a course project in university, as a group of 8.

## Goal
create a project-taking app inspired by the likes of Jira and Trello

## Features
Our app features divide into two parts, following our two user bases:

#### Instructor :
- Manages students into groups, & assigns roles
- Creates projects and assigns them to groups
- Creates tasks and assigns them to group members
- Rates tasks
- Chat with individual students, full groups, and the whole class
- Views group progress, deadlines, recent chat messages, and all projects through a dashboard page
##### Note: the instructor has the below featues as well.

#### Students :
- Drag tasks in a kanban board, based on their statuses
- Add comments & resources on individual tasks
